# DeepMed : AI-POWERED MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM

Welcome to our AI-driven healthcare project! We've developed a web-based system for the University of Gondar College of Medical Science that uses AI and advanced technology to improve medical diagnosis and treatment.

Our system combines computer vision, language processing, and machine learning to enhance patient care. It can accurately diagnose diseases, saving time and costs for patients. Medical professionals benefit from reduced workload and improved decision-making.

We've used tools like PyTorch, Scikit Learn, Streamlit, and a MySQL database to create a user-friendly system. Our focus is on efficiency and accuracy, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and allowing doctors to concentrate on patient care.

The project has three main parts:

* Computer Vision: We use AI models like ResNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, and EfficientNet to detect diseases from medical images. Our approach boosts accuracy and covers conditions such as melanoma, COVID-19, and more.

* Natural Language Processing (NLP): We've built a chatbot using RNNs and NLP techniques. This chatbot can answer medical questions quickly and accurately based on a vast collection of medical texts.

* Structured Machine Learning: Our system predicts diseases using user-input symptoms. With algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, we've trained our model on extensive medical records to provide precise diagnoses.

This project aims to revolutionize healthcare by using AI to enhance medical science and patient care.
