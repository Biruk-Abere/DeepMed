# DeepMed : AI-POWERED MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM

Welcome to our AI-driven healthcare project! We've developed a web-based system for the **University of Gondar College of Medical Science** that leverages AI and advanced technology to revolutionize medical diagnosis and treatment.

## Features

- **Computer Vision:** Using cutting-edge models like ResNet and VGGNet, our system detects diseases from medical images with high accuracy.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Our chatbot, powered by RNNs, provides quick and accurate responses to medical queries using a vast collection of medical texts.

- **Structured Machine Learning:** Predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms using powerful algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines.

## Benefits

- Save **time and costs** with accurate diagnoses, reducing the need for unnecessary hospital visits.

- **Empower medical professionals** by lightening their workload and enhancing decision-making capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch
- Scikit Learn
- Streamlit
- MySQL database
