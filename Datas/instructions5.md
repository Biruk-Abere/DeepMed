Secondly, the project concentrates on natural language processing (NLP), aiming to develop a proficient chatbot capable of answering medical queries. The system utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and various NLP techniques, including tokenization, stemming, and bag of words. By training the chatbot model on an extensive dataset of medical texts, it gains the ability to provide prompt and accurate medical advice while accurately responding to users' medical questions.
