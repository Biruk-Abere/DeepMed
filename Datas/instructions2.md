# DeepMed: AI MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS
This project aims to develop a web-based framework for the University of Gondar College of Medical Science that integrates computer vision, natural language processing, and structured machine learning techniques to enhance medical diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging artificial intelligence and deep learning, the framework can provide accurate diagnoses, reduce the need for physical hospital visits, and alleviate the workload of medical professionals.
