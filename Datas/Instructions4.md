Zero-shot classification refers to a machine learning task where a model is required to classify or recognize objects or categories that it has never seen or been trained on before. In traditional supervised classification tasks, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, and during inference, it predicts the classes for new examples based on the knowledge it gained from the training data.

However, in zero-shot classification, the model is expected to generalize to unseen classes without explicit training on those classes. Instead, it relies on the information it learned during training about the relationships between known classes and attributes or semantic embeddings associated with the classes. These semantic embeddings are often represented as vectors or embeddings in a high-dimensional space that capture the relationships and similarities between different classes.
